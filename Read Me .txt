-We can now add pictures to firebase. ALthough I'm not sure how to get them back, I keep running into this weird 
error
-We also can now add users to our database. Each user has a list of items that holds the items they are selling. 
-We can now upload pictures from peoples phones into database. 
	but they just go into the databse, I need to find a way to put them in the store and also in the 
	Users list of items on firebase.

1.) Need to get chat working. Not sure if doing it in a fragemnt is the best option. 
2.) Need to create recycler view for the items in the store. 
	2.1) Need to make a search bar/ Filter bar 
3.) Make the User page Say Hello to the user and also allow the User to have a profile picture 
		Ask the user to take pictures when they first log in 
		Figure out how to get images back from the firebase 
4.) Try to add a wish list for items for the users
5.) This UI is Hideous and I did everything with constraint layouts cuz Linear us STUPID! [Akshi FIGHT ME].
If yall wanna make any kind of changes to the UI I AM DOWN FOR IT! lol 
6.) My hope/dream is that all we'll have to do on Sunday is just make the presentation video and THAT'S IT. 
7.) Prevent app from going into portrait mode

Bonus:
If there is time, which i doubt there will be[let's be real lol], we can also try to add some "settings" options. 
Maybe some edit profile options.
